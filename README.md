# About Me Front End

This is a portfolio application for me. It showcases fullstack abilities between this, a Vue.js front end and [this](https://github.com/gatorjuice/about_me_api) back end API. The production application is hosted at https://about-me-frontend-vue.herokuapp.com/ and the production API is at https://about-me-backend-api.herokuapp.com/

As a come across conecpts I'd like to try out, I add them to this project to use as a reference later and a teaching aid in my work as a tech-lead at Actualize Coding Bootcamp.
