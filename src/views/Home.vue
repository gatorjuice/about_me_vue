      <p class="lead mb-5">
        This project exists for educational and experimentational reasons.
        Written in Vue.js, it consumes a Rails API. Between the front and back
        ends, I demonstrate work with numerous technologies and concepts. It's a
        bit of a hodgepodge of features but the purpose is to have a place to
        try new ideas without needing to boilerplate a whole new project for
        each one, a production-level sandbox for concepts

        <p>
          This web application is part personal portfolio and part open-ended
          exercise to gain expertise in Vue.js. Having worked mainly server-side
          in my time as an engineer, I have always looked for a good client-side
          counterpart to get excited about. ReactJS hasn't been able to do that
          for me. Vue.js is sensical, approachable, and &#8212; my favorite part
          &#8212; corporately detached.

        <p>
          I have a much better understanding of Ruby on Rails so I'm using this
          backend to strive deeper with best practices and try out concepts I
          don't get to work with that often. API is JSON ReST.
